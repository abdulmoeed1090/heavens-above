# ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Automation Documentation

This documentation explains how GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to automate various aspects of a web application project at **XYZ Corp** ‚Äî including testing, deployment, maintenance, and documentation.

---

## üß± Project Overview

The goal was to use **GitHub Actions** to automate development tasks such as building, testing, deploying, and maintaining the project.  
Automation improves efficiency, code quality, and ensures smooth deployment cycles.

## ü™ú Steps Followed During the Assignment
## Repository Setup

Created a GitHub repository named task-manager-app.

Added application source code and project files.

Created .github/workflows/ directory for YAML workflow files.

Enabled GitHub Actions in the repository settings.

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Install dependencies (optional, if using a static site generator)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
